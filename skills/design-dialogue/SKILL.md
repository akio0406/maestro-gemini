# Design Dialogue Skill

Activate this skill when beginning Phase 1 of Maestro orchestration. If Plan Mode is available (`experimental.plan: true` in settings), call `enter_plan_mode` at the start of Phase 1 to indicate that design work is in progress. If Plan Mode is not available, proceed in normal mode — use `ask_user` with `type: 'yesno'` for design approvals and `type: 'choice'` for approach selection. This skill provides the structured methodology for conducting design conversations that converge on approved architectural designs.

**User confirmation sequence**: Phase 1 entry triggers two user-facing confirmations — first the `activate_skill` consent dialog (required for non-builtin skills), then the `enter_plan_mode` transition (if Plan Mode is enabled). Both are expected; do not treat the second confirmation as redundant or skip it.

## Question Framework

### Principles
- Ask one question at a time — never batch multiple questions
- Prefer multiple choice format with 2-4 options over open-ended questions
- Lead with your recommended option and explain the rationale
- Wait for user response before proceeding to next question
- Adapt follow-up questions based on previous answers

### Required Coverage Areas

Ask questions in this order to progressively narrow the design space:

1. **Problem Scope & Boundaries**
   - What specific problem are we solving?
   - What is explicitly out of scope?
   - What are the expected inputs and outputs?

2. **Technical Constraints & Limitations**
   - Existing technology stack and infrastructure
   - Compatibility requirements with existing systems
   - Performance budgets (latency, throughput, resource limits)
   - Team expertise and familiarity

3. **Technology Preferences**
   - Language and framework preferences
   - Database and storage requirements
   - Third-party service dependencies
   - Build and deployment toolchain

4. **Quality Requirements**
   - Performance targets (response time, concurrent users)
   - Security requirements (authentication, authorization, data protection)
   - Scalability expectations (growth projections, peak loads)
   - Reliability requirements (uptime, disaster recovery)

5. **Deployment Context**
   - Target environment (cloud provider, on-premise, hybrid)
   - CI/CD pipeline requirements
   - Monitoring and observability needs
   - Operational constraints (team size, on-call, maintenance windows)

### Question Format

Use `ask_user` with `type: 'choice'` for structured selections:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "header": "[Short Label]",
      "question": "[Topic Area]: [Clear, specific question]",
      "type": "choice",
      "options": [
        { "label": "[Option A]", "description": "(Recommended) [Why this is recommended, key benefits]" },
        { "label": "[Option B]", "description": "[When this makes sense, trade-offs]" },
        { "label": "[Option C]", "description": "[When this makes sense, trade-offs]" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `header`: Short label displayed as a chip/tag. Must not exceed 16 characters (enforced by Gemini CLI validation). Examples: `Database`, `Auth`, `Runtime`.
- `options`: 2-4 items, each with `label` (1-5 words) and `description`

Include your recommendation rationale in the question text so the user has context before choosing.

## Approach Presentation

### When to Present Approaches
Present 2-3 architectural approaches after gathering sufficient requirements (typically after covering scope, constraints, and technology preferences).

### Approach Format

For each approach, provide:

```
### Approach [N]: [Descriptive Name]

**Summary**: [2-3 sentence overview]

**Architecture**:
[Component diagram or description showing key components and their relationships]

**Pros**:
- [Concrete advantage with context]
- [Another advantage]

**Cons**:
- [Concrete disadvantage with context]
- [Another disadvantage]

**Best When**: [Specific conditions where this approach excels]

**Risk Level**: Low | Medium | High
```

### Presentation Rules
- Always lead with your recommended approach
- Explain why the recommended approach best fits the gathered requirements
- Highlight the key differentiator between approaches
- After presenting all approaches, explicitly ask the user to choose
- Accept user's choice without pushback, even if it differs from your recommendation

## Design Convergence Protocol

### Section-by-Section Presentation

Present the design document in sections, validating each before proceeding. Each section should be 200-300 words.

**Presentation Order** (matches `templates/design-document.md` structure):
1. Problem Statement
2. Requirements (Functional, Non-Functional, Constraints)
3. Approach (Selected Approach, Alternatives Considered)
4. Architecture (Component Diagram, Data Flow, Key Interfaces)
5. Agent Team
6. Risk Assessment & Mitigation
7. Success Criteria

### Validation Format

After each section, use `ask_user` with `type: 'yesno'` for approval:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "header": "Approve",
      "question": "Does this section accurately capture our discussion? Any changes needed before I proceed to [next section name]?",
      "type": "yesno"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Revision Protocol
- If user requests changes, revise the section and re-present
- Track which sections are approved vs pending
- Do not proceed to the next section until current section is approved
- If a later section reveals issues with an earlier section, flag the conflict and propose resolution

## Design Document Generation

### Output Location

The write path depends on whether Plan Mode is active:

- **Plan Mode active**: Write to `~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>-design.md` (the only writable location during Plan Mode). After `exit_plan_mode` approval in Phase 2, the orchestrator copies it to the permanent location.
- **Plan Mode not active**: Write directly to `<state_dir>/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>-design.md` (`<state_dir>` resolves from `MAESTRO_STATE_DIR`, default `.gemini`).

Where:
- `YYYY-MM-DD` is the current date
- `<topic-slug>` is a lowercase, hyphenated summary of the task (e.g., `user-auth-system`, `data-pipeline-refactor`)
- `<project>` is the CLI's internal project hash (resolved automatically by `write_file`)

### Document Structure
Use the design document template from `templates/design-document.md`.

### Completion Criteria
The design document is complete when:
- All sections have been presented and approved by the user
- The agent team composition matches the task requirements
- Phase dependencies are clearly mapped
- Success criteria are measurable and specific
- The user has given explicit final approval of the complete document

### Post-Generation
After writing the design document:
1. Confirm the file path to the user
2. Summarize key decisions made during the dialogue
3. Ask if the user is ready to proceed to implementation planning (Phase 2)
