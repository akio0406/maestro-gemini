prompt = """Run a focused debugging session to investigate and diagnose the following issue:

{{args}}

## Execution

1. Delegate to the `debugger` agent with the issue description above
2. The debugger will follow its systematic methodology:
   - Reproduce: understand expected vs actual behavior
   - Hypothesize: form 2-3 likely root causes
   - Investigate: trace execution flow, examine logs, inspect state
   - Isolate: narrow to the specific code path and condition
   - Verify: confirm root cause explains all symptoms
3. Present the debugger's findings including:
   - Root cause summary
   - Evidence (specific files, lines, log entries)
   - Execution trace from trigger to failure
   - Recommended fix with specific code location
   - Regression prevention suggestion

If no issue description is provided via args, ask the user to describe the problem they are experiencing."""
