prompt = """Run a performance analysis on the following scope:

{{args}}

## Execution

1. Delegate to the `performance-engineer` agent with the scope above
2. The performance engineer will follow its systematic methodology:
   - Baseline: establish current performance metrics
   - Profile: identify hotspots using appropriate tools
   - Analyze: determine root cause of bottlenecks
   - Recommend: propose optimizations ranked by impact-to-effort ratio
3. Present findings with:
   - Performance baseline and key metrics
   - Bottleneck identification with evidence
   - Optimization recommendations ranked by impact
   - Expected improvement estimates
   - Measurement plan for validating improvements

If no scope is provided via args, ask the user to specify which files, directories, or components to analyze."""
